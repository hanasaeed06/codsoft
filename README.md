TASK1: CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES:

We have to build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching
techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow.

TASK2: TIC-TAC-TOE AI:

We have to implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax with
or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable.This project will help you understand game theory and basic search algorithms.

TASK3: RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM:

We have to create a simple recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences. You can use techniques like
collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend movies, books, or products to users.
